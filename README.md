# 👋 Hey there, I'm Dessy! 

Welcome to my database-driven corner of the digital world. I'm a data enthusiast with a strong focus on databases, and I also have a knack for Python. Here's a glimpse into my journey and my latest project:

## 🎓 Academic Background

I began my academic journey with a Business Administration degree and an Intellectual Property degree, exploring the intricacies of innovation and creativity in the tech and music industry.

## 🗃️ Data Enthusiast

My path led me to the captivating realm of data. SQL quickly became my trusted companion as I delved into databases, honing my skills with databases like PostgreSQL and. MySQL.

## 🛠️ Database Wizard

- 🧙‍♂️ PostgreSQL Pro: I'm a PostgreSQL aficionado, crafting robust database solutions with it (or at least I try to be).
- 🌐 SQL Maestro: I've dabbled in MySQL and I'm not afraid of other SQL dialects, ensuring data integrity and performance.
- 💼 Data Architect: I design database schemas that lay the foundation for data-driven applications.

## 🐍 Python Enthusiast

While SQL remained close to my heart, I also embraced Python. I ventured into object-oriented programming and embarked on exciting projects, combining my love for data with the power of Python. Additionally, I'm passionate about data science and the art of analyzing data, where I constantly explore data insights and patterns.


## 🎸 Current Project: SpotiCode

My current project is all about music. I'm crafting a rock music database that's not just your ordinary collection of songs but a gateway to the world of rock, seamlessly integrated with Spotify. Get ready for an immersive musical experience!

This project aims to curate a comprehensive collection of rock music, carefully selected to reflect my musical preferences. Using the power of Python, I'm creating dynamic and captivating Spotify playlists that showcase the best of rock music (and not only 😉). Additionally, I'm diving deep into the data that Spotify provides, analyzing trends, genres, and the ever-evolving landscape of music.

Stay tuned for a journey through the world of music, where data meets melody, and playlists come to life with a touch of Python magic.
